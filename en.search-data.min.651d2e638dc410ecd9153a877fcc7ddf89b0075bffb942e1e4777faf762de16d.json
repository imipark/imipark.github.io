Good questions drive data use and decision-making.\nCore Idea\nThe 4-step data mining workflow:\n(1) Pose question → (2) Find data → (3) Transform data → (4) Analyze\nHow It Works\nFrame a question (e.g. SLE + clot risk), identify cohorts, extract patient timelines, compute outcomes.\nHow It Connects\nFoundation for the entire course. All downstream steps depend on having a well-framed question.\n🏥 Module 2: Data Available from Healthcare Systems # What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem?\nClinical data is complex, biased, and scattered across different sources.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nUnderstanding data provenance is essential for valid interpretation and modeling.\nCore Idea\nTypes of healthcare data (structured, unstructured), who produces them, and common biases/errors.\nHow It Works\nLearn data sources: EMRs, claims, pharmacies, registries. Understand missingness, selection bias, coding issues.\nHow It Connects\nThese data sources fuel patient timelines and features (Modules 3–4). Knowing their limitations is critical.\n🕰️ Module 3: Representing Time in Clinical Data # What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem?\nMost clinical events happen over time, but databases don\u0026rsquo;t naturally express time relationships.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nMisaligned event timing distorts exposures and outcomes — ruins inference and prediction.\nCore Idea\nUse patient timelines. Choose timescales, bins, and encode order of events.\nHow It Works\nDefine index time (exposure), align with outcome, handle right-censoring, test for non-stationarity.\nHow It Connects\nPrepares data for feature engineering (Module 4). Enables temporal reasoning in phenotyping (Module 6).\n🧱 Module 4: Creating Analysis-Ready Datasets # What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem?\nRaw timeline data is too messy for analysis or ML.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nPoorly engineered features → invalid conclusions and unfair models.\nCore Idea\nConstruct a patient-feature matrix. Engineer features from timeline + structured data.\nHow It Works\nClean → normalize → impute → reduce → create new features. Use knowledge graphs for semantics.\nHow It Connects\nStructured input for downstream modeling and phenotyping. Builds on Module 3 and supports Module 6.\n📄 Module 5: Handling Unstructured Data (Text, Images, Signals) # What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem?\nImportant clinical info is buried in unstructured formats like notes, scans, signals.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nIgnoring this info causes mislabeling or missing key predictors.\nCore Idea\nUse NLP and signal/image processing to extract structured features.\nHow It Works\nNLP → detect negation/context → extract features using knowledge graphs. Apply to text/images/signals.\nHow It Connects\nComplements Module 4. Enables richer feature sets and more accurate phenotyping (Module 6).\n🧬 Module 6: Electronic Phenotyping # What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem?\nWe need to determine who really has the condition of interest, but it’s not always explicit in data.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nPhenotyping determines cohort inclusion and outcome labeling — critical for valid research.\nCore Idea\nUse rule-based or machine learning–based methods to define presence of disease/condition.\nHow It Works\nDefine inclusion/exclusion criteria (rules), or train classifiers using imperfect labels and anchors.\nHow It Connects\nRelies on timelines (3), features (4), and text (5). Prepares labeled cohorts for modeling or trial selection.\n⚖️ Module 7: Clinical Data Ethics # What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem?\nUsing clinical data without safeguards risks privacy violations and public mistrust.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nEthics is essential for legal compliance, public trust, and fairness in AI.\nCore Idea\nApply ethical frameworks (Belmont Report, Learning Health System) to govern data use and consent.\nHow It Works\nUse informed consent, de-identification, appropriate return of results, and respect patient autonomy.\nHow It Connects\nApplies across all modules. Ensures responsible use of all clinical data workflows and AI tools.\n🧠 Final Integration Flow # Ask Smart Questions (Module 1) →\nUnderstand Data Sources \u0026amp; Biases (Module 2) →\nTrack Time and Events Correctly (Module 3) →\nTransform into Clean Features (Module 4) →\nExtract from Unstructured Formats (Module 5) →\nDefine Conditions Precisely (Module 6) →\nUse Ethically \u0026amp; Fairly (Module 7)\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/healthcare_courses/course2_clinical_data/clinical_text_mining_pipeline/","title":"Clinical Text Mining Pipeline","section":"Course2 Clinical Data","content":" 🏥 Clinical Text Mining Pipeline (Steps 1–5) # This document outlines a high-level clinical text mining pipeline using knowledge graphs, NLP, and structured indexing.

Should Be Measured But Wasn’t # Description: The value is expected but is missing due to random or procedural issues (e.g., lab error, missed test). Technical Term: MCAR: Missing Completely At Random MAR: Missing At Random Example: A routine blood test wasn\u0026rsquo;t recorded because the sample was lost. Strategy: Impute (mean, median, or model-based). Add a missingness indicator variable (e.g., var_missing = 1). Rationale: The missingness is unrelated to the value itself, so estimation is relatively safe. 2. Mostly Zero Due to Rare Occurrence # Description: Not truly missing — the value is zero or absent for most patients because the condition/event is rare. Technical Term: Not Missing (No abbreviation needed) Example: HIV diagnosis column is 0 for most patients. Strategy: Do not impute — the 0s are meaningful and reflect true absence. Rationale: These are real values, and zeros carry clinical meaning. 3. Deliberately Not Recorded # Description: Clinician or system chooses not to record a value based on context (e.g., patient clearly stable or too ill). Technical Term: MNAR: Missing Not At Random Example: Sodium level not tested because the patient was clearly stable. Strategy: Avoid imputation if possible — it may introduce bias. Use models that handle missingness natively (e.g., decision trees, XGBoost, LightGBM). Consider adding a missingness indicator. Rationale: The missingness depends on the unobserved value and may carry predictive signal. Summary Table # Case Description Abbreviation Impute?

Real-World Data (RWD: EHR, Claims, Registries) – Observational and confounded, requiring advanced causal inference methods to extract meaningful insights.\n🔗 Relationship: Clinical Data is typically highly structured and standardized, whereas RWD is heterogeneous, requiring bias correction.\n2️⃣ Data Management \u0026amp; Standardization (Processing \u0026amp; Infrastructure Level) This layer ensures that raw clinical \u0026amp; real-world data are cleaned, structured, and made interoperable for analysis.\nHealthcare Informatics – The framework for data integration, ETL processes, standardization (OMOP, FHIR, CDMs), interoperability, and terminology mapping (SNOMED, LOINC, ICD).\n🔗 Relationship:\nHealthcare Informatics acts as a bridge between data collection (clinical \u0026amp; RWD) and analytics. Without informatics, AI models and statistical analyses would lack clean, structured, and standardized data. 3️⃣ Data Analytics \u0026amp; Decision Intelligence (AI \u0026amp; Statistical Analysis Level) This layer applies statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models to structured and unstructured healthcare data for actionable insights.\nTraditional Data Science \u0026amp; Statistical Analysis (Used for both Clinical \u0026amp; RWD)\nBiostatistics, Bayesian Methods, Survival Analysis, Causal Inference (PSM, DAGs, DiD) Used to control bias, estimate treatment effects, and generate regulatory-grade evidence (RWE). AI in Healthcare (Machine Learning \u0026amp; Deep Learning Applications)\nSupervised Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) Deep Learning (CNNs, Transformers, NLP, Reinforcement Learning) Model Interpretability (SHAP, LIME) and AI Fairness (Bias Mitigation) 🔗 Relationship:\nAI \u0026amp; ML rely on structured, clean data (from Healthcare Informatics) and leverage Clinical Data \u0026amp; RWD to generate predictions and automate decision-making. Statistical analysis methods (causal inference, survival analysis) are critical for ensuring valid results before AI is applied.
