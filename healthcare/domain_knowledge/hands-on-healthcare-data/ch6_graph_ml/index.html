Ch6 Machine Learning & Graph-Based Analytics




  Part 1: Q&amp;A Summary
  #


  1. What is the difference between cleaning, harmonization, and feature engineering?
  #


Cleaning: Removing errors or inconsistencies in the raw data.
Harmonization: Mapping and aligning data semantically across datasets (e.g., converting NDC to RxNorm).
Feature Engineering: Transforming data to fit the needs of specific algorithms or analysis (e.g., PCA, one-hot encoding).


  2. Why are graphs more useful for harmonization than feature engineering?
  #


Graphs help link concepts across vocabularies, terminologies, or systems.
Feature engineering tends to be model-specific and harder to generalize.


  3. What are the downsides of repeating cleaning/harmonization for each project?
  #


Redundancy: Same steps are repeated across projects.
Inefficiency: Each team member duplicates similar work.
Inconsistency: No central source of truth for processed data.


  4. What is a feature store and how does it help?
  #


A feature store centralizes reusable, preprocessed features.
Helps reduce redundancy and promotes consistency.


  5. How do knowledge graphs improve the pipeline?
  #


Data is cleaned and harmonized once at the graph level.
All downstream users can reuse the harmonized view via queries or APIs.


  6. What assumptions are made when using a knowledge graph?
  #


Patient-level data and terminology concepts are stored in the same graph.
Nodes/edges are tagged with metadata (e.g., timestamps, source).
The graph is a supergraph enabling subgraph extraction.


  7. What are graph embeddings and why are they useful?
  #


They convert graph structures into vectors usable in ML models.
Enable pattern detection, similarity analysis, and deep learning.


  8. What is node2vec?
  #


Random walk-based graph embedding technique.
Uses return (p) and in-out (q) parameters to tune graph walk.
Captures homophily and structural equivalence.


  9. What is cui2vec?
  #


Embeds UMLS CUIs based on co-occurrence in various RWD sources.
Context-aware (claims, notes, publications).
Useful for understanding concept similarity.


  10. What is med2vec?
  #


Uses temporal sequence of medical events to create visit-based embeddings.
Retains longitudinal context.


  11. What is snomed2vec?
  #


Embeds SNOMED CT concepts using hierarchical and network-based methods.
Includes alternatives like metapath2vec and Poincaré embeddings.


  12. What are some challenges with pretrained embeddings?
  #


Risk of overfitting to training data domain (e.g., CMS claims).
May not generalize well to other populations or use cases.
Introduces extra model layer to maintain and tune.



  Part 2: Curriculum-Style Breakdown with &ldquo;Why&rdquo;
  #


  🧭 Phase 1: Understand the Motivation
  #


Task: Read and distinguish between cleaning, harmonization, and feature engineering.

Why: Clarifies each pipeline component and prevents misuse of graphs for tasks like feature engineering.




  🧱 Phase 2: Explore Pipeline Challenges
  #


Task: Analyze Figures 6-6 to 6-9 on pipeline repetition and inefficiency.

Why: Understand how lack of standardization leads to duplicated efforts.




  🧠 Phase 3: Learn about Feature Stores
  #


Task: Study how feature stores centralize and reuse engineered features.

Why: Saves time, increases reproducibility, and reduces tech debt.




  🌐 Phase 4: Integrate Knowledge Graphs
  #


Task: Understand what goes into a knowledge graph (patient data &#43; ontologies).

Why: Enables one-time harmonization per data source, allowing scalable reuse.




  🧩 Phase 5: Explore Graph Embedding Techniques
  #


Task: Implement node2vec on a small graph.

Why: Learn homophily vs structural equivalence, key for biomedical graph reasoning.




  🧬 Phase 6: Biomedical Concept Embeddings
  #


Task: Compare and contrast cui2vec, med2vec, and snomed2vec.

Why: Appreciate how embeddings differ by data type (temporal, co-occurrence, hierarchical).




  ⚠️ Phase 7: Real-World Concerns with Embeddings
  #


Task: Evaluate pretrained embeddings and consider limitations (overfitting, generalizability).

Why: Embeddings may look good on paper but can fail in new domains.




  🔁 Phase 8: Apply to Your Use Case
  #


Task: Pick a small real-world use case and simulate a pipeline using a knowledge graph and embedding.

Why: Reinforces learning and identifies operational gaps in pipeline design.
