## AI in Healthcare Agenda

### Healthcare Data – From Clinical Trials to Real-World Data

- **AI in Healthcare** – Clinical Data, Evaluations of AI Applications (*Coursera – Stanford*)
- **Clinical Data Science** – Hands-on training in structured clinical data (*EHR, OMOP, CDM*), computational phenotyping, predictive modeling, and clinical NLP (*Coursera – UColorado*)
- **Hands-On Healthcare Data** – *Healthcare Informatics & Knowledge Graph* (Book – Andrew Nguyen)

### Causal Reasoning for Healthcare Decision

- **A Crash Course in Causality** – Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data (*Coursera – PennMed*) 
- **Causal AI** – Structural Causal Models (*SCMs*) using DoWhy, enabling automated causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and intervention-based AI systems (*altdeep.ai*)

### Knowledge-Driven Healthcare Decision

- **Knowledge Graphs** – Enabling structured reasoning for clinical decision support (*Neo4j*).
- **Knowledge Graph-Enhanced RAG** – Combining structured medical knowledge with AI-driven retrieval to deliver context-aware, accurate, and explainable clinical insights (*Neo4j with LangChain*).
