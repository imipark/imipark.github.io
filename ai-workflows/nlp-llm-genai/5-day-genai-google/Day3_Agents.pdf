# Day 3 – Agents: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Summary

---

## 1. Introduction to Agents

AI agents represent a leap from passive LLMs to **goal-oriented, reasoning-capable systems** that operate autonomously. Each agent is built with:
- A **model** (e.g., LLM or multimodal base)
- **Tools** (APIs, functions, data access)
- An **orchestration layer** (for memory, planning, reasoning with CoT, ReAct, etc.)

> This brings up the question: **How do we actually operate and evaluate such complex entities?**

---

## 2. AgentOps and Related Practices

AgentOps is the operational discipline of building, deploying, monitoring, and evaluating agents—just like DevOps or MLOps for software and ML.

- **AgentOps includes**: versioning, CI/CD, metrics, observability, tool orchestration, memory handling.
- Sits alongside PromptOps and RAGOps under GenAIOps.

> If we can observe agents well, we can improve them effectively—so let’s define the success metrics.

---

## 3. Agent Success Metrics

Metrics guide production decisions. Key metrics include:
- **Goal completion rate**
- **Critical task success**
- **Telemetry** (latency, error rates)
- **Human feedback** (thumbs up/down, rating forms)

Traces and logs help with internal observability—especially critical for debugging LLM-driven actions.

> Now let’s shift to evaluating not just what agents do—but **how** they do it.

---

## 4. Agent Evaluation

Agent evaluation isn’t just final outputs—it includes **decision-making and trajectories**. Three major areas:
1. **Assessing Capabilities** (reasoning, tool use, planning)
2. **Evaluating Trajectories** (step-by-step plans)
3. **Evaluating Final Response** (does it hit the goal?)

Approaches:
- Use public benchmarks (AgentBench, PlanBench, τ-bench)
- Ground-truth trajectory evaluations (exact match, in-order match, recall, precision)
- Autoraters (LLMs judging LLMs)
- Human-in-the-loop (direct assessment, user studies)

> But how does this scale when we go from one agent to many?

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Systems & Design Patterns

Multi-agent systems are teams of autonomous agents with specialized roles:
- **Planner, Retriever, Execution, Evaluator agents**
- **Design patterns**: Sequential, Hierarchical, Collaborative, Competitive

Advantages:
- Accuracy, Parallelism, Specialization
- Reduced bias and hallucination
- Better scalability and fault tolerance

> With this power comes complexity—what components make this work?

---

## 6. Architecture of Multi-Agent Systems

Key components:
- Interaction Wrappers
- Memory (short/long, shared)
- Reasoning engine (CoT, ReAct, ToT)
- Tool registry / dynamic usage
- Routing/Delegation
- Communication protocols
- Feedback Loops
- Agent Mesh (ontology, discovery, registry)

> This architecture unlocks new potential—but also introduces major challenges.

---

## 7. Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems

- Task communication and handoffs
- Context management across async sessions
- Coordinating reasoning and planning
- Debugging and observability
- Runtime and latency cost
- Overall system complexity

> So, how do we evaluate multi-agent systems as a whole?

---

## 8. Evaluating Multi-Agent Systems

Same principles as single-agent—plus:
- **Agent Utilization**: Did the right agents get used?
- **Plan adherence**: Did agents stay on task?
- **Coordination**: How well did they collaborate?
- Evaluate trajectories **at agent-level and system-level**

> All this sets the stage for next-gen use cases like **Agentic RAG**.

---

## 9. Agentic RAG: Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Agentic RAG improves standard RAG pipelines using agent autonomy:
- Query expansion
- Multi-step reasoning
- Adaptive source selection
- Retrieval validation

Enhances accuracy and adaptability for complex use cases (legal, scientific, healthcare).

> For maximum benefit, we also need to upgrade our **search and grounding stack**.

---

## 10. RAG Optimization Techniques

To improve search:
- Use **semantic chunking** (e.g., Vertex Layout Parser)
- Add metadata for filtering and ranking
- Fine-tune embeddings or adaptors
- Use faster vector DBs (like Vertex AI Vector Search)
- Add re-rankers and grounding checkers

> Now let’s look at **enterprise-level deployments** using agents.

---

## 11. Agents in the Enterprise

Two major types:
1. **Assistants** – interact with users, return results
2. **Automation agents** – work in background, monitor events, trigger workflows

Knowledge workers become **managers of agents**, orchestrating tasks via UIs. Tools like **Google Agentspace** enable:
- Low/no-code agent creation
- Access control
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Monitoring and dashboards

> Google’s tools take this even further with **secure, multimodal, grounded RAG agents.**

---

## 12. Google Agentspace and NotebookLM

**Agentspace** offers:
- Multimodal RAG
- Enterprise access control and governance
- Personalization via user context/history
- Prebuilt SaaS connectors
- Support for async workflows

**NotebookLM Enterprise**:
- AI-powered research assistant
- Summarization, question answering, audio synthesis
- Built-in enterprise-grade security and compliance

> Together, these form the basis for scalable, customizable AI agents for real business impact.

## 13. From Agents to Contractors

To increase agent reliability, the next evolution is **contract-adhering agents**. Instead of vague goals, agents now operate under formalized contracts with:

- Clear outcomes
- Task scopes
- Cost/duration expectations
- Negotiation mechanisms
- Feedback loops
- Subcontracts for decomposition

This transforms agents from “best-effort responders” into **accountable entities** with measurable deliverables.

---

## 14. Agent Contracts in Action

- **Contracts** define deliverables, specs, reporting cadence.
- **Negotiation** handles ambiguity, cost, scope.
- **Subcontracts** allow recursive breakdown of tasks.
- **Contract lifecycle** includes definition → negotiation → execution → feedback.

> This formal structure enables agents to work like reliable, scalable freelancers.

---

## 15. Case Study: Google’s AI Co-Scientist

A live example of multi-agent architecture in scientific discovery:

- **Data Processing Agents**: Handle large-scale biological data.
- **Hypothesis Generators**: Use prior knowledge to propose explanations.
- **Validation Agents**: Simulate and verify hypotheses.
- **Collaboration Agents**: Share learnings across research teams.

Used in liver fibrosis research to discover new mechanisms and drugs.

---

## 16. Real-World Deployment: Automotive AI

A showcase of agents deployed in vehicles:

- **Navigation Agent**
- **Media Agent**
- **Messaging Agent**
- **Manual Agent**
- **General Knowledge Agent**

Each agent specializes in a domain. Together, they form a seamless in-car experience with fast local inference + cloud augmentation.

---

## 17. Multi-Agent Patterns in Automotive Use

**Hierarchical Pattern**  
- Orchestrator delegates to specialized agents  
- Maintains context, handles fallback

**Diamond Pattern**  
- Rephraser modifies responses before user delivery  
- Adjusts tone/style for context or user preference

**Peer-to-Peer**  
- Agents can hand off tasks between each other  
- Adds resilience when routing fails

**Collaborative Pattern**  
- Agents contribute complementary parts of an answer  
- Response Mixer combines them for completeness

**Adaptive Loop Pattern**  
- Agents iterate through query reformulations  
- Continuously refine results until satisfied
