# üß† Introduction to Multimodal LLMs

Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of understanding and reasoning over both **textual and visual inputs** (and sometimes more, like audio or video). They are designed to bridge the gap between language and perception, enabling tasks such as visual question answering, image-grounded reasoning, and visual commonsense inference.

## üîß Core Components of a Multimodal LLM

1. **Visual Encoder**  
   Converts input images into feature embeddings. Common choices include CLIP, ViT, and EVA.

2. **Modality Adapter (Aligner)**  
   Projects or transforms visual features to be compatible with the language model‚Äôs embedding space (e.g., via MLP or cross-attention).

3. **Language Model (LLM)**  
   A large pretrained language model (e.g., LLaMA, GPT) that consumes both text and aligned visual inputs to generate or classify responses.

# üîÑ How Multimodal LLMs Combine Textual and Visual Embeddings

Understanding how multimodal large language models (LLMs) fuse visual and textual information is critical to designing or using such models effectively. Here's a concise breakdown.

## üß† Fusion Strategies in Multimodal LLMs

### 1. Projection + Token Injection
**Models**: BLIP-2, LLaVA  
**How it works**:  
- Visual features are extracted using a frozen image encoder (e.g., ViT or CLIP).
- These features are projected via an MLP to match the LLM's token embedding size.
- The projected visual tokens are **prepended or interleaved** with text tokens.

```python
# Hugging Face-style pseudocode
image_embeds = vision_encoder(image)         # Shape: (batch, num_patches, hidden_dim)
projected_embeds = visual_proj(image_embeds) # Match LLM hidden size
input_embeds = torch.cat([projected_embeds, text_token_embeds], dim=1)
output = llm(inputs_embeds=input_embeds)
```

---

### 2. Cross-Attention Adapters
**Models**: Flamingo, MiniGPT-4  
**How it works**:  
- Visual tokens are kept separate from text tokens.
- The LLM has **cross-attention layers** where text tokens attend to visual context.

```python
# Pseudocode with cross-attn
text_embeds = llm.text_embeddings(text_input)
visual_context = vision_encoder(image)

for block in llm.transformer_blocks:
    text_embeds = block.self_attn(text_embeds)
    text_embeds = block.cross_attn(text_embeds, context=visual_context)
```

---

### 3. Joint Pretraining (Early Fusion)
**Models**: Unified-IO, GIT, PaLI  
**How it works**:  
- Images are tokenized (as patches or regions).
- Both image and text tokens are passed together into a unified transformer.

```python
# Pseudocode for joint vision-text transformer
image_tokens = patch_embed(image)            # ViT-style patch tokens
text_tokens = tokenizer(text)
all_tokens = torch.cat([image_tokens, text_tokens], dim=1)
output = joint_transformer(all_tokens)
```

| Fusion Strategy          | Fusion Level     | Example Models        | Notes                                |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Projection + Injection   | Input Embedding  | BLIP-2, LLaVA          | Easy to integrate with frozen LLM    |

## üí° Tips for Dataset Preparation
- Use consistent image size (e.g., 224x224 or 1024px height).
- Add **visual prompts** (e.g., red circles, boxes) directly to images if needed.
- Construct **text prompts** with instructions or multiple-choice format.
- Match visual tokens to text tokens via aligned embedding space or adapter layers.

## üìö Expanded Overview: Inputs and Data Preparation for Multimodal LLMs

Multimodal LLMs are language models that can process and reason over **multiple data types**, especially:

- **Text**
- **Images**
- *(Optionally: audio, video, or other modalities)*

They are designed to understand **both visual and linguistic context**, enabling tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, grounding, and perception-based reasoning.

---

### üß† Simplified Architecture

Most multimodal LLMs follow this **3-part pipeline**:

1. **Visual Encoder**  
   ‚Üí Converts image(s) into embeddings (e.g., using CLIP, EVA, ViT)

2. **Modality Adapter**  
   ‚Üí Aligns visual tokens with the text token space (projection or attention bridging)

3. **Language Model (LLM)**  
   ‚Üí Receives both textual and visual embeddings to generate or classify text

### üñºÔ∏è + üí¨ Input Format

Inputs typically include:

- **Image(s)**: RGB images, optionally annotated (e.g., bounding boxes, circles)
- **Text Prompt**: Task instruction or question (e.g., "Which object is closer?")
- **Answer Choices** (optional): For classification-style tasks like BLINK

```python
inputs = {
  "images": [...],   # preprocessed (resized, normalized) tensors or raw image paths
  "text": "Which point is closer to the camera? (A) A (B) B"
}
```

Some APIs accept JSON-style mixed prompts with interleaved text and image tokens.

### üß™ Data Preparation Pipeline

1. **Image Collection**  
   Use open datasets (COCO, LVIS, IIW, WikiArt) or your own; resize consistently (e.g., 224x224 or 1024px).

2. **Visual Prompt Annotation**  
   Add circles (keypoints), boxes (objects), or masks (regions) using tools like OpenCV, CVAT, or FiftyOne.

3. **Text Prompt Design**  
   Write clear, natural or templated questions.
   - e.g., "Which image completes the jigsaw?"
   - e.g., "Is the laptop to the left of the bear?"

4. **Label Encoding**  
   - Classification: (A), (B), (C), (D)
   - Generation: Free-text string
   - Evaluation: Ground-truth match or similarity

### üì¶ Example Entry (BLINK-style)

```json
{
  "image_1": "img001.jpg",
  "image_2": "img002.jpg",
  "prompt": "Which point corresponds to the reference point (REF)? (A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D",
  "visual_prompts": {
    "ref_point": [x1, y1],
    "candidates": [[x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4], [x5, y5]]
  },
  "answer": "C"
}
```
