Should Be Measured But Wasn‚Äôt # Description: The value is expected but is missing due to random or procedural issues (e.g., lab error, missed test). Technical Term: MCAR: Missing Completely At Random MAR: Missing At Random Example: A routine blood test wasn\u0026rsquo;t recorded because the sample was lost. Strategy: Impute (mean, median, or model-based). Add a missingness indicator variable (e.g., var_missing = 1). Rationale: The missingness is unrelated to the value itself, so estimation is relatively safe. 2. Mostly Zero Due to Rare Occurrence # Description: Not truly missing ‚Äî the value is zero or absent for most patients because the condition/event is rare. Technical Term: Not Missing (No abbreviation needed) Example: HIV diagnosis column is 0 for most patients. Strategy: Do not impute ‚Äî the 0s are meaningful and reflect true absence. Rationale: These are real values, and zeros carry clinical meaning. 3. Deliberately Not Recorded # Description: Clinician or system chooses not to record a value based on context (e.g., patient clearly stable or too ill). Technical Term: MNAR: Missing Not At Random Example: Sodium level not tested because the patient was clearly stable. Strategy: Avoid imputation if possible ‚Äî it may introduce bias. Use models that handle missingness natively (e.g., decision trees, XGBoost, LightGBM). Consider adding a missingness indicator. Rationale: The missingness depends on the unobserved value and may carry predictive signal. Summary Table # Case Description Abbreviation Impute?
